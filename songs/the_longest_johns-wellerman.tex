    \begin{verse}
        There ^{a}once was a ship that put to sea \\
        And the ^{d}name of that ship was the ^{a}Billy o' Tea \\
        The ^{a}winds blew hard, her bow dipped down \\
        ^{E}Blow, me bully boys, ^{a}blow (hoo-ah!)
    \end{verse}
    \begin{chorus}
        ^{F}Soon may the ^{C}Wellerman come \\
        To ^{G}bring us sugar and ^{a}tea and rum \\
        ^{F}One day, when the ^{C}tonguing is done \\
        We'll ^{G}take our ^{E}leave and ^{a}go
    \end{chorus}
    \begin{verse}
        She had not been two weeks from shore \\
        When down on her a right whale bore \\
        The captain called all hands and swore \\
        He'd take that whale in tow (hoo-ah!) 
    \end{verse}

        Soon may the Wellerman come\ldots

    \begin{verse}
        Before the boat had hit the water \\
        The whale's tail came up and caught her \\
        All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her \\
        When she dived down below (hoo-ah!)
    \end{verse}
    \begin{chorus}
        Soon may the Wellerman come\ldots
    \end{chorus}
    \begin{verse}
        No line was cut, no whale was freed \\
        An' the captain's mind was not on greed \\
        But he belonged to the Whaleman's creed \\
        She took that ship in tow (hoo-ah!)
    \end{verse}
    \begin{chorus}
        Soon may the Wellerman come\ldots
    \end{chorus}
    \begin{verse}
        For forty days or even more \\
        The line went slack then tight once more \\
        All boats were lost, there were only four \\
        And still that whale did go
    \end{verse}
    \begin{chorus}
        Soon may the Wellerman come\ldots
    \end{chorus}
    \begin{verse}
        As far as I've heard, the fight's still on \\
        The line's not cut, and the whale's not gone \\
        The Wellerman makes his regular call \\
        To encourage the captain, crew and all
    \end{verse}

        Soon may the Wellerman come\ldots $\times 2$
