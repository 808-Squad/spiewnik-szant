        \textit{(It starts with\ldots)} \\
        ^{d}One thing, I don't know why \\
        It ^{C}doesn't even matter how hard you try \\
        Ke^{B}ep that in mind, I designed this rhyme \\
        To expla^{C}in in due time \textit{(all I know)} \medskip \\
        Time is a valuable thing \\
        Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings \\
        Watch it count down to the end of the day \\
        The clock ticks life away \textit{(it's so unreal)} \medskip \\
        Didn't look out below \\
        Watch the time go right out the window \\
        Tryin' to hold on, I didn't even know \\
        I wasted it all, just to\ldots \textit{(watch you go)} \medskip \\
        I kept everything inside \\
        And even though I tried, it all fell apart \\
        What it meant to me will eventually be \\
        A memory of a time, when\ldots

        I tried so ^{d}hard and got so f^{F}ar \\
        But in the e^{C}nd, it doesn't even ma^{B}tter \\
        I had to ^{d}fall to lose it a^{F}ll \\

        One thing, I don't know why \\

        Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme \\
        To remind myself how\ldots \textit{(I tried so hard)} \medskip \\
        In spite of the way you were mockin' me \\
        Actin' like I was part of your property \\
        Rememberin' all the times you fought with me \\
        I'm surprised it\ldots \textit{(got so far)} \medskip \\
        Things aren't the way they were before \\
        You wouldn't even recognize me anymore \\
        Not that you knew me back then \\
        But it all comes back to me \textit{(in the end)} \medskip \\
        You kept everything inside \\
        And even though I tried, it all fell apart \\
        What it meant to me will eventually be \\
